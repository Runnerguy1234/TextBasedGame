# Currently Nameless Text Based Game

The goal with this project is to create a text based game with few limitations as to what the player can do with their surroundings.

I plan to implement an inventory system similar to the one in Homestuck, which may or may not be the sole purpose of this project in the first place.

# Building

To build, run the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
